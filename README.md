## Usage

Check out the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ebshimizu/soothsayer/wiki) for usage information and instructions.

## Developing

This should get you started:
```
git clone
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you don't want to use yarn, npm should work just fine.
New overlays should be placed in `src/obs_src`. See the existing overlays for examples.
Semantic-ui and jQuery are available in both the controller and the overlays.
